<h2>Playlists</h2>
<p>Playlists are ordered lists of songs that allow you to plan your DJ sets.</p> 
<p>Some DJs construct playlists before they perform live, but others prefer to build them on-the-fly. 
   When using a playlist during a live DJ set, remember to always pay close attention to how your audience
    reacts to the music you've chosen to play. It may be necessary to skip some songs in your prepared
    playlist or add some different songs in order to maintain the energy of your audience.</p>
