Mixxx - version 0.9.2.


* HOMEPAGE *************************************************
http://mixxx.sourceforge.net


* ABOUT ****************************************************
Mixxx is software for DJ'ing, using custom or 
commercial MIDI controllers. You can use wave based
audio files or MP3 files as audio input.
This release works on Linux (OSS Sound Drivers), Windows and 
Mac OS 10.2.


* REQUIREMENTS *********************************************
Mixxx is based on the following libraries:
QT >= 3 
libMAD
libAudioFile
PortAudio

The Windows version uses libsndfile instead of libAudioFile.


* INSTALL **************************************************
You can either install Mixxx from binary, or from source.
If you choose to install from source you should use a
version of PortAudio from the mixxx cvs tree, which has been
patched to work optimally with Mixxx regarding latency.

The binary linux version is distributed as an RPM file, and
the version is statically linked to the patched PortAudio
library, so you don't need to have that installed to get 
Mixxx working.

The Machitosh and Windows versions, installs by extracting 
the downloaded file to a folder.

The files in /usr/share/mixxx is definitions for various
MIDI controllers. You can change the placement of the
default place to look for midi config files, by editing
the variable CONFIG_PATH in mixxx.pro.


* RUN THE PROGRAM ******************************************
Run the program by double clicking on the Mixxx application
icon or typing mixxx at the prompt. Mixxx uses text based 
configuration files. The first time it is started it 
will create a directory, .mixxx in your home directory 
containing the main configuration file mixxx.cfg. Most of 
the options written to this file can be changed in the 
preference dialog.

Mixxx can use any midi controller for input. More info 
on the file format can be found on the home page. You can
either place your definition files in /usr/share/mixxx or
in another dir of own choice. The programs searches for
midi config files in the directory listed in mixxx.cfg 
under [Midi]Configdir.
