* ABOUT ****************************************************
Mixxx is software for DJ'ing, using custom or 
commercial MIDI controllers. You can use wave based
audio files, Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files as audio input.
This release works on Linux (OSS Sound Drivers), Windows and 
Mac OS 10.2.

* REQUIREMENTS *********************************************
Mixxx is depends on the following libraries:
QT >= 3.1 
libMAD
libAudioFile
vorbisfile
FFTW 2

The Windows version uses libsndfile instead of libAudioFile.


* INSTALL **************************************************
You can either install Mixxx from binary, or from source.

*Linux:
The linux version is distributed as package files (RPM),
built for various distributions. To compile and install from 
source use the following commands:
cd src
qmake mixxx.pro
make
cd ..
./install.pl
This will install the program in /usr/bin with midi configs
and skins in /usr/share/mixxx. The placement of the skin and
midi configs can be changed in the users ~/.mixxx.cfg file
created after the first startup of the program. 

*Mac and Windows:
Extract the downloaded file to a folder and start the
installation by double-clicking on the program.
The midi configs and skins are placed in the application
directory (application bundle on mac). A configuration
file mixxx.cfg is written to the users home directory
containing the Mixxx preferences as set in the preference
panel.

* RUN THE PROGRAM ******************************************
Run the program by double clicking on the Mixxx application
icon or typing mixxx at the prompt (Linux).

Mixxx can use any midi controller for input. More info 
on the file format can be found on the home page. Also
you can make your own skins for Mixxx. Take a look at the
skin.xml file for each of the two skins provided if you want
to make your own.

If you have any problems starting Mixxx, eg. after changeing
options in the preference panel, you can reset the Mixxx
configuration by deleting your mixxx.cfg file (.mixxx.cfg on
Linux). If the program runs very slow, you can disable the
waveform displays. This is done by running Mixxx from the
command line using the option --disable-visuals. If you hear
cracks in the sound or the program stops for small periods
this is often because your computer is not fast enough. Try
increasing the latency.

* DEVELOPMENT **********************************************
If you are interested in joining the development team of
Mixxx you are most welcome. Especially we are looking for
people to help with adding support for various sound api's, 
eg. ALSA, ASIO, Jack, Arts etc. Also we are interested in
hearing about how you use Mixxx, what features you would 
like, if you have used any special midi controllers,
designed your own skin etc.
