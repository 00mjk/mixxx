controllers including MIDI devices, and more.

* UPGRADING ************************************************

We recommend deleting your old skins directory before
installing a new version of Mixxx. SCONS may not properly
overwrite your skins directory when you do a "scons install",
and it might cause Mixxx to crash on launch.
You can delete it by running:

   $ sudo rm -rf /usr/share/mixxx/skins
   $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/mixxx/skins


* INSTALL **************************************************
Mixxx has the following dependencies:
- fftw3
- libid3tag
- libmad
- libogg
- libvorbis
- libvorbisfile
- libaudiofile
- PortAudio-v19
- QT3
- libjack (now required)
- scons

NOTE: If you want JACK support in Mixxx, make sure you 
compile PortAudio-v19 with JACK support first.

Mixxx's build system is now SCONS as of Mixxx 1.6.0. 
To compile Mixxx using SCONS, go into the "mixxx"
directory and run:

   $ scons
  
SCONS does both dependency checking and building, so it will
tell you if you're missing any of the dependencies listed above.
It's also possible to specify a prefix path and additional
build flags, for example:

   $ scons prefix=/usr vinylcontrol=1
   
To install Mixxx after compilation, run:

   $ scons prefix=/usr vinylcontrol=1 install
