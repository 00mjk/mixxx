Mixxx - version 0.9.1.


* HOMEPAGE *************************************************
http://mixxx.sourceforge.net


* ABOUT ****************************************************
Mixxx is software for DJ'ing, using custom or 
commercial MIDI controllers. You can use wave based
audio files or MP3 files as audio input.
Currently the software works on Linux using the
OSS sound drivers, but work has been done on porting
to other architectures.


* REQUIREMENTS *********************************************
Mixxx is based on the following libraries:
QT >= 3 
libMAD
libAudioFile
PortAudio

Apart from PortAudio these libraries are included in most
Linux distributions. PortAudio can either be installed
from source (http://www.portaudio.com) or download as an
RPM (we keep one in the download section of
http://mixxx.sourceforge.net).


* INSTALL **************************************************
You can either install Mixxx from binary, using the RPM at
the website, or from source. Be aware that no dependency 
information is included in the RPM. If you cannot find an 
RPM for PortAudio it's also available at the homepage. If 
you are using Gentoo Linux you will most probably be able to 
emerge mixxx, and having the needed libraries installed 
automatically.

To install Mixxx, edit mixxx.pro to use the drivers
you want. You'll probably want to stick with the
default since this is the only ones which is well
tested.

Then do the following commands to compile:
qmake mixxx
make

Copy mixxx to /usr/bin and copy the content of the config
directory to /usr/share/mixxx. These commands will do the
job:
cp mixxx /usr/bin
mkdir -p /usr/share/mixxx
cp config/* /usr/share/mixxx

The files in /usr/share/mixxx is definitions for various
MIDI controllers. You can change the placement of the
default place to look for midi config files, by editing
the variable CONFIG_PATH in mixxx.pro.


* RUN THE PROGRAM ******************************************
Run the program by typing mixxx. Mixxx uses text based 
configuration files. The first time it is started it 
will create a directory, ~/.mixxx containing the main 
configuration file mixxx.cfg. Most of the options written
to this file can be changed in the preference dialog.

Mixxx can use any midi controller for input. More info 
on the file format can be found on the home page. You can
either place your definition files in /usr/share/mixxx or
in another dir of own choice. The programs searches for
midi config files in the directory listed in mixxx.cfg 
under [Midi]Configdir.
