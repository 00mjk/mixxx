This release works on Linux (OSS Sound Drivers), Windows and 
Mac OS 10.2.

* REQUIREMENTS *********************************************
Mixxx is based on the following libraries:
QT >= 3 
libMAD
libAudioFile

The Windows version uses libsndfile instead of libAudioFile.


* INSTALL **************************************************
You can either install Mixxx from binary, or from source.

The binary linux version is distributed as an RPM file, and
the Machitosh and Windows versions, installs by extracting 
the downloaded file to a folder.

The files in /usr/share/mixxx are definition files for 
various MIDI based controllers are 
placed in /usr/share/mixxx on Linux, and in subfolder of the 
application called config on Windows and MacOS X. You can 
change the placement of the default place to look for MIDI
config files, by editing the variable CONFIG_PATH in 
mixxx.pro when compiling from source. 


* RUN THE PROGRAM ******************************************
Run the program by double clicking on the Mixxx application
icon or typing mixxx at the prompt. Mixxx uses text based 
configuration files. The first time it is started it 
will create a directory, .mixxx in your home directory 
containing the main configuration file mixxx.cfg. Most of 
the options written to this file can be changed in the 
preference dialog.

Mixxx can use any midi controller for input. More info 
on the file format can be found on the home page. You can
either place your definition files in /usr/share/mixxx
(on linux) or in another directory of own choice. The 
program searches for midi config files in the directory 
listed in mixxx.cfg under [Midi] Configdir.


* DEVELOPMENT **********************************************
If you are interested in joining the development team of
Mixxx you are most welcome. Especially we search for persons
to work on the artistic side of the graphical interface.
