Configuration of keyboard, Midi and other external controllers for
use with Mixxx.

Tue Haste Andersen <haste@diku.dk>, November 2003.



*** Keyboard ***

Keyboard configuration is saved in a file called Standard.kbd.cfg which
on linux resides in /usr/share/mixxx/keyboard, on Mac is included in the
application bundle, and is in the application directory on Windows.

The format of the file is really simple. There is four sections:
[Master], [Flanger], [Channel1] and [Channel2]. For each sections a number of
controls in the program can be assigned keyboard shortcuts.

For the master section the following controls are available:
crossfader
balance
volume
headVolume
headMix

These controls are all range controls, that is they can be assigned an up or 
a down event, ie. a certain key can be assigned to turn the volume up or down.
That is done by adding _up or _down to the control value listed above. Thus to
create a keyboard mapping for "o" turning volume down, and "p" turning volume
up, the Standard.kbd.cfg file would contain three lines:
[Master]
volume_down o
volume_up p

The flanger uses these controls:
lfoDepth
lfoDelay
lfoPeriod 

They are also range control, ie. append _up or _down to them.

For each channel the following range controls is available:
pregain
filterLow
filterMid
filterHigh
rate
wheel			- Same as dragging the waveform with the mouse
playposSlider		- Seek file position

Furthermore a number of push button controls is available:
flanger - turn flanger on or off
filterLowKill		- kill buttons for filters
filterMidKill
filterHighKill
pfl			- Headphone on/off
play
reverse
fwd
back
cue_set
cue_goto
cue_preview
rate_perm_down
rate_perm_up
rate_temp_down
rate_temp_up


*** MIDI ***

Midi is configured in the same way as the keyboard. Different configurations
can be saved in files ending with .midi.cfg and are placed in a subdirectory
called midi, found the same place as the keyboard sub directory.

The format is basically the same as for keyboard configuration, but instead of
the keyboard key, the midi key value is entered into the file along with the
midi channel, as eg. mapping the a midi key 36 at channel 6 to the play button
in Mixxx:
[Channel1]
play Key 36 ch 6

*** Powermate, Joysticks ***

This is Linux only. The configuration goes into a midi configuration file like
above but for Powermate channel 17 is used, and channel 19 is used for
Joystick.
