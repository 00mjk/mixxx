Mixxx MIDI Mappings XML Format

Mixxx uses a well defined XML format to store its MIDI mappings. The format is used for storing and distributing MIDI mappings from multiple scopes.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<MixxxMIDIPreset version="1.6.0"> <!-- Version number to help compatibility, should the MIDI format change -->
	<info><!-- Optional - information about the preset file -->
		<name>Example MIDI Preset for Mixxx</name>
		<author>Tom Care</author>
		<description>This is an example XML MIDI preset for Mixxx. The scope of the preset could be from a small functionality addition, to a complete mapping for a controller, to a complex personal setup with multiple controllers. This description is intended for distribution and could include comments about the extent of the functionality.</description>
	</info>
	
The first part of the file defines the version of the mapping (for future compatibility, as the Mixxx MIDI abilities become more complex) and an optional info tag which contains information about the preset (primarily used for distribution of presets). 	
	
	<controller id="Device name of the controller" port="Port"> <!-- Many controllers in one file supported. A controller should only appear once -->
	
The core part of the file contains a definition for a single controller. There may be multiple controllers in one file (for more complex setups). Each controller definition contains two sections: input bindings (controls) and output bindings (only lights are supported at the moment).

		<controls> <!-- One control group -->
			<control> <!-- Several controls -->
				<group>[Master]</group>
				<key>crossfader</key>
				
Group and key define the part of Mixxx that is being controlled. For a list of what these values can be, see http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/ui_midi_controls_and_names.

				<miditype>Ctrl</miditype>
				<midino>7</midino>
				<midichan>3</midichan>
				<controltype>fader</controltype>
				
These tags define the MIDI event that Mixxx will listen for. Controltype hints to Mixxx what kind of control this is: for most controls this will define the behaviour of the control (eg jog wheel, analog knob). There is also a generic control enabling someone to define the behaviour using options.

				<options>
					<!-- all control specific options should go here - sensitivity etc. Specifics to be decided by spec -->
				</options>
				
The options further refine be behaviour of the control. The list of options will expand as Mixxx development continues. Eg - translations, sensitivity, acceleration. Necessary options (defined by controltype) will have default values, eg a jogwheel might have no acceleration by default.
				
			</control>
		</controls>
		<outputs>
		
The next section defines the outputs (lights only at the moment).

			<light>
				<group>[Channel1]</group>
				<key>play</key>
				<status>0x7F</status>
				<midino>0x08</midino>
				<threshold>0.1</threshold>
				
Status is the value sent to the MIDI controller. Threshold is the value at which the light turns on.
				
			</light>
		</outputs>
	</controller>
