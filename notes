Leave the MIDI subsystem alone since it's closely tied with the GUI. Make a new one.

Controller:
    properties:
    - name
    - is input device
    - is output device
    - is open
    members:
    - scriptEngine
    functions:
    - open(scriptFile)
        opens comms with controller then starts up scriptEngine,
        loads supplied (and common) script files & runs init script function
    - close
        deletes scriptEngine (running shutdown script function) then closes comms with controller
    - receive (from controller to Mixxx)
    - send (from Mixxx to controller)

ControllerManager:
    properties:
    - list of Controller*s
    Spawns one thread for all Controllers under it

Make GUI hierarchy:
